request.py prompts user for artist name
searches for the singles release on one website and finds the singles lyrics on the other.
It prints the number of words in each song lyrics.

To run you need to have pip installed the request package

then run "py request.py"

Please note
    I think the number of records that can be requested from the release website are limited and the records sent are not always the same for a given artist hence the releases that print out may vary.
